This comes through in the intricate fusion of eastern and western designs that my customers have come to love.",`We like to say, "Every kitchen can be an Italian kitchen." Luca's is our way of keeping the tradition of Italian cooking alive and thriving. Come learn with us.`,"A partnership born in Brooklyn, NY, we took our love of modern design to create a line that delivers quality and celebrates bold simplicity. We aim to dress those who also love understated comfort with a touch of nostalgic vibes fit for any occasion.","Starting out as women's fashion buyers and teaming with the best up-and-coming designers, we're leading the way in athletic and athleisure wear for everyone. We stand out from the competition with feel-good products made in the USA.","We created a true partnership where every worker receives fair compensation so they can truly be proud of their contribution. We are a family company that believes in the product of human compassion expressed through every essential cup.","We're a group of scientists and aestheticians with a shared connection for natural products that are easy on our skin, as well as our minds. By choosing the best ingredients and using the right methods, we've created a line of products we can all feel good about.","From humble beginnings as a family-owned business, we bring our small-town charm online for a convenient shopping experience that feels as quality-driven as our products. Better yet, our furniture is made using wood from reforested groves.","Starting out as a fun hobby to surprise all the special people in my life, I branched out after requests starting piling up. Putting my sales right back into my business, I decided to finally open my very own shop and workspace.","After a tough time finding kids and baby toys that were unique and delightful, we decided to create them ourselves. After our initial success selling locally, we branched out to creating accessories that keep your little ones happy.","We're proud to offer the highest quality, most unique merchandise on the market today.  From our family to yours, we put lots of love and careful attention in each item. We hope you enjoy our work as much as we enjoy bringing it to you.","We're a mom and pop shop, passing along a one-on-one customer service mindset that fits with the ease of online shopping. We bring our love of animals to every product we offer for the next generation to celebrate the pets they love so much.","As former starving artists, we understand the value of the dollar. But we don't think fine design should only be available to the rich. That's why we started this business\u2015to bring art and printing together in a way that democratizes access to original design.","After growing up in Sienna, my sister and I decided to bring our love of Tuscan flavors to the modern dining mecca of San Francisco. We wanted to combine the authentic tastes of home with the new forward-thinking food movements of Northern California to present a non-traditional, traditional Italian dining experience.","As a product designer, I set out to apply what I know to what I wish existed out in the world: minimalist design that serves a function and fills the world with color. I wanted to create quality products in both form and function.","We took our hobby of collecting from junkyards and fixing just about everything and turned it into a business that supplies tools and parts while celebrating what's cool about fixing everything under the sun.","Quinn, San Francisco","Testimonials","Testimonial 1","Testimonial 2","Testimonial 3","Testimonial 4","Testimonial 5","Attribution","Testimonial image","Quote","\u201CI love being able to find just the right gifts for my friends at a great value.\u201D","Add a quote to complete section setup","Sariah, 27, Minneapolis","James, 31, Austin","Antonio, 38, Colorado",'"LOVE gifting these\u2014it shows I put thought into it and cherish talks at mealtime."',`"There's nothing like home-cooked meals the way they were meant to be presented."`,`"I'm plate-obsessed chef.
